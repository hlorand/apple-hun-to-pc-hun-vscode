# Apple Hungarian Layout to PC Hungarian Layout

This extension replaces special characters when you type on Apple’s Hungarian keyboard layout with the original characters present on a regular 101-key Hungarian keyboard, fixing the layout. 

*The only differences are these characters: type `*` with `AltGr + á`, and type `;` with `AltGr + -`*
